All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad

I don't know what's wrong with me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't know what's wrong with me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I love parties, but I don't go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacin' out when somebody talks

I wanna be rich, but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone who hates me
